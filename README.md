## Building

The site is built using the [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) static site generator.
The source codes to the examples can be found in the `content` directory.
When you build the site using the `hugo` command, the output files will be generated into the `public` directory.

To build this site Hugo and Python (with `pygments` installed) will be required.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gowebexamples/gowebexamples.git
$ cd gowebexamples
$ hugo
```

## Running

Start a server with the [LiveReload](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#livereload) enabled:

```console
$ hugo server
```
